#30. What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person?

# In object-oriented programming, the relationship between Student and Person is appropriately modeled using inheritance. This is 
# because a Student is a specialized form of a Person. Inheritance allows the Student class to inherit the attributes and methods of 
# the Person class, and to extend or override them as needed.
