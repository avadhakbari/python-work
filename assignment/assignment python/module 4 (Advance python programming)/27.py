# #27. What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?

# >>> In object-oriented programming (OOP), instantiation refers to the process of creating a specific instance of a class. When a 
# class is defined, it acts as a blueprint for objects. Instantiation is the act of taking that blueprint and creating a real, usable
#  object based on it.
