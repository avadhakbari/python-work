#28. What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?

# n Python, the isinstance() function is used to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or a tuple of classes. 
# This function returns True if the object is an instance of the class (or one of the classes in the tuple) and False otherwise.

# syntax:
# isinstance(object, classinfo)
